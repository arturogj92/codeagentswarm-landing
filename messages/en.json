      "q1": "How do I use multiple Claude Code terminals with CodeAgentSwarm?",
      "a1": "CodeAgentSwarm makes multi-terminal Claude Code setup simple. Just open the app and you can run up to 6 Claude Code terminals simultaneously. Each terminal operates independently, letting you work on different tasks or projects in parallel with full real-time visibility.",
      "q2": "How does CodeAgentSwarm handle project-level organization?",
      "a2": "CodeAgentSwarm lets you manage multiple Claude Code projects seamlessly. Switch between projects without losing context. Each project maintains its own terminal configurations, task boards, and conversation history. It's an AI multiproject workspace designed for developers juggling multiple codebases.",
      "q3": "Do I get real-time visibility and live change tracking?",
      "a3": "Yes! CodeAgentSwarm provides real-time coding visibility with live diffs so you can see AI code changes in real-time. Dynamic terminal titles show what each Claude Code agent is working on, and the file tracking system highlights exactly what changed and when.",
      "q4": "Does CodeAgentSwarm support Claude Code notifications?",
      "a4": "Absolutely. You get real-time notifications for AI coding events. When any Claude Code terminal finishes a task, needs your input, or encounters an error, you'll know instantly. Never miss an update with instant desktop notifications.",
      "q5": "How does conversation history work?",
      "a5": "CodeAgentSwarm saves your complete Claude Code conversation history across all sessions. Search any past chat, decision, or code snippet instantly. Session history is fully searchable, so you never lose context or have to repeat explanations.",
      "q6": "Can I control what Claude Code has access to?",
      "a6": "Yes. CodeAgentSwarm provides visual Claude Code permission settings to manage file access and actions. You can configure what each terminal can access, approve sensitive operations, and maintain a secure AI coding environment while using Turbo Mode for safe actions.",
      "q7": "Does CodeAgentSwarm support MCP tools and the MCP marketplace?",
      "a7": "Yes! CodeAgentSwarm includes full MCP integration with a built-in MCP marketplace. Connect Claude Code to GitHub, Notion, Slack, Supabase, Brave Search, Playwright, PostgreSQL and more. MCP tools extend what your Claude Code agents can do.",
      "q8": "Does CodeAgentSwarm help prevent context loss in Claude Code?",
      "a8": "Yes. CodeAgentSwarm keeps a synchronized conversation history across terminals, shows real time changes from each agent and links project structure with terminal context. This prevents Claude Code from forgetting past actions or losing track during multi step work."

        "a1": "Yes. During the Open Beta, the entire Pro tier is free - all features unlocked, no credit card required.",
        "q2": "Do I need a Claude Code subscription?",
        "a2": "Yes. CodeAgentSwarm works on top of Claude Code, which powers all agentic reasoning, coding, parallel tasks and MCP tools. You need an active Claude Code subscription to run the agents.",
        "q3": "Is Claude Code Max recommended?",
        "a3": "Highly recommended. If you work on multiple projects, heavy refactors, large codebases or parallel tasks, Max delivers better performance and higher request limits.",
        "q4": "Why do I need to join Discord?",
        "a4": "Beta requires feedback. Discord is where we post updates, take feedback, fix bugs, and share Beta builds.",
        "q5": "What happens when the Beta ends?",
        "a5": "You choose: stay on Free, upgrade to Pro, or stop using the app. No automatic charges. Founders who join during the beta will keep the original Pro price forever.",
        "q6": "What OS is required?",
        "a6": "macOS (Apple Silicon). Windows/Linux coming later.",
        "q7": "Does CodeAgentSwarm store my code?",
        "a7": "No. All code stays on your local machine.",
        "q8": "How long does Pro activation take?",
        "a8": "Usually a few hours after you complete all steps.",
        "q9": "Does CodeAgentSwarm support multi-project workflows with Claude Code?",
        "a9": "Yes! CodeAgentSwarm is designed for multiproject management. Switch between Claude Code projects without losing context. Each project maintains its own terminals, tasks and conversation history. Manage multiple Claude Code projects seamlessly in one workspace."
